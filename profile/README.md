# Hi there, we are NekoTech Foundation! 👋

Founded by [@akk1to](https://github.com/akk1to) in September 26, 2025, we began as a small Discord group with a single goal: recreating a manga reader. That initial project laid the foundation for the team we are today—a group of passionate developers building innovative tools and impressive digital experiences.

# What do we do? 🔥

We work on a lot of project, including [KentaBucket](https://kentabucket.nekofoundation.tech), NekoAI, NekoComics and more! Join our [Discord Server](https://discord.nekofoundation.tech) to learn about or project, and become a tester, so we can release our project as soon as possible!
